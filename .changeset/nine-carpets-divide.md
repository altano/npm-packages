"@altano/remark-mdx-toc": patch
---

Create fork of remark-mdx-toc (`remark-mdx-toc` => `@altano/remark-mdx-toc`). `unified` v11 came with a lot of breaking changes and the ecosystem is mostly slowly catching up, but some plugins have not been updated. `remark-mdx-toc` hasn't been updated so let's just pull it into this repo and clean it up.
