# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I make no claims to support any package out of this repository, including support for security issues. This is a hobby repository and those who need support or security promises *must* look elsewhere.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You may report vulnerabilities to altano@gmail.com and, while I make no support promises, I may respond to the vulnerability report.
